When changing code in other files that are imported, we need to restart the jupyter kernel and rerun all the cells to initialize everything. But we already know the values of the previous calibration, and if we are in the same room, with the same map and the same thymio, we know these value shouldn't change by a large margin. The two new functions will initialize everything, paste the values found earlier, and won't run the calibration process again.

With this offset, we managed to correct the position in y from the camera's perspective, but it wasn't perfect either. We still had an error of approximatively ±5mm. Based on the exercise of week 8 again, we decided to set $r_p$ = 0.01 But while testing this, we also managed to see the variance on the position from the camera's perspective.

    "### Kalman_adjust\n",
    "\n",
    "With the kalman filter, we get an estimated position of our thymio, from our multiple sensor. But we still need to use these informations. Because of our environement and path finding choices, we have decided to run the Kalman_adjust per cell. This means that we will run the correction *per steps*. We take the center of our thymio from the kalman's estimated position, and take the difference with the center of the next targeted cell. The goal is for the thymio to face the center of this cell. This is what Kalman_adjust do. It computes the angle required to reach the center of the next targeted cell, compares it with the actual thymio's orientation, and runs a proportionnal controller to fix the error. We found two approaches: in both case, we increase the speed of one wheel, while we decrease the speed of the other. This will lead to a rotation of the thymio. Then we could either decide to let this different in speed be, and expect kalman to correct the speed at every sampling time, or, the second approach, the one we went with, set this difference in speed, and let it run for a little time, then reset the speed back to normal. We have decided to set the duration to two sampling time, to be sure it would be long enough for it to affect the locomotion. The first option has also been tested, but resulted in a lot of oscillation from the thymio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gain was set experimentally. We know that the $k_p * \\omega * t$  ($\\omega$ being the angular velocity) shouldn't exceed the difference in angle from the desired orientation and the actual one. We could've increased the gain up to this limit but found the value of 2.5 was good enough, without being too agressive.\n",
    "Finally, we have also made the choice of ignoring a difference in angle bellow our threshold of 7°, because of this imperfection of our setup, and the camera's deformation."
